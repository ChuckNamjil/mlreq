# Mongolian Layout Task Force (mlreq)

This group explores gaps and requirements for support of languages using the traditional Mongolian script on the Web and in Digital Publications.

It aims to address the problem that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their language on the Web, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which provides a heat-map for language issues on the Web.  You can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=mlreq) page. (That link applies an `mlreq` filter.)

For more details about scope, deliverables, work methods, etc., see the [group's charter](https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/charter/).

### Feedback
Please use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/mlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)

Note that the public-i18n-mongolian mailing list is used to send notification digests & meeting minutes. It is **not** for technical discussion.

**You may raise issues in Chinese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Chinese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**

That list is notified (no more than once a day, and in digest form), about changes to issues in this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the African writing systems.
